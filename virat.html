  Kohli's international career began in August 2008 when the 19-year-old had a "surprise call-up" to the ODI squad for a tour of Sri Lanka.[29] He opened the batting due to injuries to senior players, scoring his first half-century in the fourth match.[30] After a brief stint with the India A team, he scored a century against a strong Australian bowling line-up in a tour match.[31] Despite an early BCCI contract, Kohli's place in the team was not secure. A turning point came in the 2009 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia, where he was the top run-scorer, leading his team to victory with a century in the final. This performance cemented his return to the national side.[32] He scored his maiden ODI century in December 2009 against Sri Lanka.[33] By early 2010, he became the third Indian to score two ODI centuries before turning 22.[34]

In 2010, Kohli was appointed vice-captain for a tri-series in Zimbabwe and became the then fastest Indian to score 1,000 ODI runs. After a dip in form during the 2010 Asia Cup, he solidified his position with consistent performances, finishing as India's leading ODI run-scorer for the year.[35] Kohli played a crucial role in India's 2011 World Cup victory, scoring a century on his debut and a 35 in the final.[36][37] Further made his Test debut in June 2011 against the West Indies, but struggled initially and was dropped.[38] He was recalled and eventually found his footing, scoring his maiden Test century in Adelaide in January 2012.[39] He continued to score runs in ODIs, with an unbeaten 133 against Sri Lanka and a career-best 183 against Pakistan in the 2012 Asia Cup, being the standout performances.[40][41]
